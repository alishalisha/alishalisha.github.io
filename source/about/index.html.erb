    <p>Hi, I'm a product designer at <a href="http://navahq.com">Nava PBC</a>. Previously, I was a Design Director at Vox Media. I work, play, and live in Washington, D.C. At Vox, I led a small team of front-end designers who work with engineers to build products and platforms that help tell our brand partners' stories both on- and off-platform. Prior to that, I helped build the branded content and partnerships business at Vox (now Vox Creative).</p>

    <p>I've <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/author/aramos/">written about</a> the cross-section between editorial, product, and design. I believe that the best work happens when <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/12/reporters-designers-and-developers-become-bffs/">developers, designers, and reporters become friends</a>, share ideas, and tell stories together. I like thinking about what it means for publishers and storytellers to <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/12/brand-relevance-and-revenue-in-the-age-of-snapchat/">live in a distributed-platform world</a>.</p>

    <p>In 2015, DCFemTech named me <a href="http://tech.co/dcfemtech-recognizes-top-30-women-programmers-2015-04">one of DC's Most Powerful Women Programmers</a>.</p>

    <p>In a former life, I worked in brand strategy consulting for Fortune 500 companies at <a href="http://prophet.com">Prophet</a>, a global consulting firm.</p>

    <p>I graduated from Harvard University in 2012, where I earned my degree in Sociology and History. While at Harvard, I ran a digital publication called <i>The Harvard Voice</i>.</p>

    <p>üìù I write a weekly newsletter on mixed identity and other personal reflections called Mixed Feelings. <a href="http://tinyletter.com/mixedfeelings">Sign up here!</a></p>
