  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="p-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
    <p>I'm currently a Product Design Director at Vox Media based in Washington, D.C. building scalable, functional, and beautiful platforms. As a child of the early 2000's, I learned how to code and design through sites like Neopets and Livejournal, and that's precisely what I do now.</p>

    <p>I enjoy: building what I design through code, learning new technologies, and hacking on zany ideas. I believe: that users always come first, engineers and designers should collaborate more, and that you shouldn't be afraid to show your work.</p>

    <p>Prior to designing, I was a brand strategy consultant in New York for several Fortune 500 companies. I graduated from Harvard University with a degree in Sociology and History.</p>

    <p>Things I like: feminism, fashion, makeup, running, <i>Fixer Upper</i>, emoji. üôã</p>

    <p>üìù I write a weekly newsletter on mixed identity and other personal reflections called Mixed Feelings. <a href="http://tinyletter.com/mixedfeelings" class="p-link">Sign up here!</a></p>
