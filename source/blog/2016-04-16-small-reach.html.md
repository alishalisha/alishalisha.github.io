A few weeks ago, I decided to start writing [a newsletter on mixed race identity](http://tinyletter.com/mixedfeelings). It's been hands down one of the best decisions I've made for myself recently. I've always loved writing, but working in tech makes it hard for me to find opportunities to write. Spending an hour or two writing the newsletter early in the morning puts me in a meditative and calm state. It feels so great to be able to create something and set it free on a regular basis.

The best thing to come from the newsletter has been the very personal responses I've received from people. The newsletter only goes to a little over 100 people, but every week I receive a few replies from readers. Often it's about something in the letter that resonated, or simply a note of thanks for writing the letter. I've also started to have people in real life drum up conversations with me about the newsletter, and I'm always so surprised and touched by how many people read the words I write.

One hundred readers isn't that large of a reach when it comes to the internet, but I'm proud of the net impact the newsletter has had so far. On others' lives and on mine too.
