I've finally put up a blog on my site! Let's get this party started. Thanks to Middleman, the [middleman-syntax](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-syntax) gem for delicious syntax highlighting, and some additional CSS I grabbed from [Alex Peattie](https://github.com/alexpeattie/alexpeattie.com/blob/master/source/assets/css/global/code.scss) to wrangle some of the syntax highlighting styling.
