The hardest part of design isn't design at all. At least, not design in the traditional sense â€” color, type, visual refinement, etc. 

As a product designer (now manager), I've come to realize the hardest part of design is figuring out the strategy, content, and flow. You don't actually do "design" in this part of the work. You might be wrangling spreadsheets, noodling over taxonomies and copy, throwing out wireframe after wireframe, testing concepts, and doing the whole thing over again. It's messy and it's hard.

Product design is so much more than just pushing pixels around to make something look nice. That's not the hard part. The hard part is making sense of chaos.
